# TDVS

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

**TDVS** is an R package for *Testing-driven Variable Selection in Bayesian Modal Regression*.
It implements efficient Bayesian variable selection methods based on a permutation-based hypothesis testing.

## Installation

You can install the development version of TDVS from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("Jiasong-Duan/TDVS")
```

Or,
```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Jiasong-Duan/TDVS")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to perform variable selection with the **TDVS** method:

```{r example}
library(TDVS)
# Load example data containing:
# - Response (Y): matrix with 100 subjects (rows) and 1 column
# - Predictors (X): matrix with 100 subjects (rows) and 8 predictors (columns)
# Note: Among the 8 predictors, only the first and third are truly important predictors
# The true values of coefficients(denoted as B hereinafter) the intercept (denoted as B0 hereinafter) are
#(2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0) and 2, respectively. 
#the Predictors are generated from a multivariate normal with mean of zero and an identity covariance matrix. 
#the Response is generated as Y= XB + epsilon, where epsilon follows MixHat(nu=3, gamma=2) which encodes a 
#heavy-tailed and right skewed distribution.  
data(data_tdvs)
head(data_tdvs$Y)
hist(data_tdvs$Y)
head(data_tdvs$X)
#Parameter estimation
par_est <- TDVS_EM(data_tdvs)
par_est[1:7]
#Variable selection with multi-stage pre-screening.
VS_scr_start <- proc.time()
VS_withscreening <- TDVS_multi_stage(data_tdvs)
VS_scr_elapsed <- proc.time() - VS_scr_start
#computational time
VS_scr_elapsed
# The output contains selected variables and the p-values for each predictor
# The output contains estimated parameters, including beta, beta0, nu, gamma, selected variables and 
#p-values for each predictor
# A p-value of -1 indicates a variable that was not selected because they failed to pass the initial two
#screening steps.
print(VS_withscreening)
#Variable selection without pre-screening. Requires longer time than the multi-stage version.
VS_noscr_start <- proc.time()
VS_noscreening <- TDVS(data_tdvs)
VS_noscr_elapsed <- proc.time() - VS_noscr_start
#computational time
VS_noscr_elapsed
print(VS_noscreening)
```
