Description: Implements variable selection methods in modal regression using 
    permutation-based statistical testing as described in "Testing-driven Variable Selection 
    in Modal Regression". The package provides efficient algorithms for 
    identification of significant predictor variables, in both small and high-dimensional datasets.
